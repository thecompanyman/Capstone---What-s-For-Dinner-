## Capstone Proposal
#### What is "What's for Dinner?"?
What's for Dinner? will be a resource where culinary-challenged people can turn to to find out what they can make with what they have in their fridge.

## Project Overview
What's for Dinner? will allow users to select ingredients they currently have in their fridge, pantry, freezer, and wherever to find a recipe that they use to those ingredients. I will first produce a functioning site to list recipes that only use what they currently have. If I am able to finish early, I'll include a separate section that lists recipes that includes those ingredients but will also need some other recipes in case the user is interested and easily able to obtain the other ingredients needed.

## Functionality
- Allow the user select from various ingredients that they may have in their home.
- Allow the user to input ingredients not pre-listed.
- Displays recipes that only use the ingredients user selected.
